# Examples

Sample data generated on IEEE123 in several formats:

- ATP generated files (.pl4)
- COMTRADE (.dat and .cfg)
- Matlab (.mat)
- csv
- hdf5

Examples include faults on a single phase, two phases, and three phases. Files include waveforms at various locations:

- iFAULT*: Fault current
- v/iSBUS: Three-phase voltage/current at the feeder substation
- iTACS_PV004[#]: See below for description of various values
  - A/X: Voltage/current waveforms
  - V/I: RMS voltage/current
  - W: Inverter frequency in rad/s
